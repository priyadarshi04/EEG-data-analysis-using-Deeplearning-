# EEG-data-analysis-using-Deeplearning-
The analysis of EEG data to classify different cognitive states using advanced deep learning techniques.

#Step-by-Step Plan

1. Load the EEG Data
Load the EEG data from the Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset on PhysioNet.
Use the MNE library for data handling and preprocessing.

3. Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis
Calculate the PSD:

Use MNE functions to compute the PSD for the rest and task states.
Focus on the frequency bands: Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-12 Hz), Beta (12-30 Hz), and Gamma (30-100 Hz).
Compare PSDs:

Plot the PSDs for both states.
Summarize the findings by comparing the PSDs for the rest and task states.

3. Deep Learning Classification
   
Feature Extraction:

Extract relevant features from the cleaned EEG data, such as band power, connectivity measures, or other features derived from the PSD.

Implement Two Deep Learning Models:

Choose two models from EEGNet, TSCeption, ViT, ATCNet, and VAE.
Implement and train the models using the extracted features.

Train and Validate the Models:

Split the data into training and validation sets.
Train the models and validate their performance.

Evaluate the Models:

Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Discuss the results and compare the performance of the two models.
